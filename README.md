## Disclaimer
Idea completely from [veryjos](https://github.com/veryjos/onehandedtyping), just wanted to add Windows support.

## OS Support
This will only work for windows as the keyboard library is only capable of canceling key press events for windows. If you need Linux support, check out [veryjos/onehandedtyping](https://github.com/veryjos/onehandedtyping)

## Getting Started
You can use the config as is, just rename `remaps.sample.json` to `remaps.json`. After installing python 3.7 and required packages, can run `py main.py`.
